# HandwritingRecognition
Algorithm to read an image of a handwritten digit.

Unfortunately, the training images was far too big of a file to upload to Git, so I have included the other three files I used in creating a matrix to accurately predict a handwritten digit. While the code won't work on a computer without the training images, I have included the text of my commented code.
